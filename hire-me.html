<h1>Available for Hire</h1>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. This page
serves as a generic cover letter of sorts to make my case for why you should
consider hiring me.</p>

<p>My work ethic is primary driven by a thirst for knowledge, solving hard
problems, and a passion for quality. Despite my young career, I am typically
very confident in my technical abilities and the solutions I propose. However,
I also recognize where my skills are lacking and I almost always maintain an
open mind and will accept competing ideas or viewpoints, especially if they
are superior to my own.</p>

<p>I will thrive in an environment where I am surrounded by individuals
sharing my passions and who offer an abundance of knowledge and talent from
which to learn.</p>

<p>In my professional career, my role has often skirted the line between
software and operations engineer. In my time at Tellme/Microsoft, I was
privileged to work alongside an operations teamthat strived for 99.999% uptime
in almost everything they managed. The lessons learned to achieve this lofty
goal have carried forward and influence many of my decisions. Also at Tellme,
I was exposed to a culture that placed paramount importance on user
experience. I also find many of my decisions guided by asking myself how
someone else will react to it. This applies not only to user interfaces, but
also API design, code layout (readability, documentation, etc), and
completeness of a solution (e.g. providing ready-to-use SDKs and documentation
for public web services.</p>

<p>I believe one of my strongest skills is the ability to quickly learn new
skills or systems and/or to assess their attributes. However, this sometimes
manifests as a weakness where I become enamored with the latest/greatest
technology. This has bitten me enough times that I am now more restrained. But,
my curiosity does occasionally run wild.</p>

<p>As stated above, I have a pssion for quality. To me, this means spending
time considering a problem before coding or actively solving it. It means
working closely with the team requesting the product to ensure a solution
meets the needs one year from now in addition to today. It means have a
testing plan (and implementing them, if that is my role) so our users aren't
the ones reporting problems and our test team can focus on more important
test problems. In means having a thorough code review with technically
proficient and honest people (who aren't afraid to grill my code - I like
being humbled by my mistakes because it makes me better in the end). It means
thorough documentation and striving for high readability. To me, this is all
part of doing my job.</p>
