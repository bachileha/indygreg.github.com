<h1>Body of Work</h1>

<i>Last updated May 13, 2011</i>

<p>This page contains information on my technical history. You can think of it
as a very descriptive resume.</p>

<h2>The College Years (2002-2006)</h2>

<p>In my 4 years at Case Western Reserve University, I dabbled into a number
of small projects and contributed to a few larger ones. Most of my efforts
were primarily focused on projects related to the university, but some
impacted people outside.</p>

<h3>Case Wiki and Related Extensions</h3>

<p>As a student employee of the university's IT team, I was responsible for
rolling at the <a href="http://wiki.case.edu/">Case Wiki</a>, a central and
unified wiki for the university. A designer prototyped the layout and I
created a MediaWiki skin for it.</p>

<p>While maintaining the wiki, I developed numerous MediaWiki extensions.
These were all released as open source. These extensions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>WikiFeeds - Provided enhanced ATOM and RSS feeds for MediaWiki. Provided
    a secure feed for an individual's watchlist. Many of the features have
    slowly been incorporated into the official MediaWiki code base. But, they
    were exclusive to WikiFeeds for years.</li>
  <li>OpenSearch - Provided OpenSearch support for MediaWiki. OpenSearch has
    since been incorporated into MediaWiki.</li>
  <li>Graph Data Structure and Visualization - Implemented a MediaWiki library
    to create graph data structures from wiki content (e.g. articles are nodes,
    links, etc are edges). Wrote an extension that turned this structure into
    Graphviz markup and rendered it into pages. Also wrote an extension for
    Touchgraph visualization of the same data.</li>
  <li>AJAX Watcher - Exposed real-time wiki changes without page refreshing via
    AJAX calls. I believe MediaWiki has since incorporated something similar.
    </li>
  <li>Farmer - Turns MediaWiki into a wiki farm from a single install.</li>
</ul>

<h3>University Single Sign-On</h3>

<p>While working for the university, I deployed
<a href="http://www.jasig.org/cas">CAS</a> as a single sign-on service for
the entire university. Previous to its rollout, individual sites were taking
login credentials from HTML forms, HTTP basic auth, etc and trying to log in
to the university's LDAP server.</p>

<p>Initially, very few services used CAS. Over time, more and more people
got on board and I'm pretty sure that now almost every site at the university
uses it.</p>

<h3>opensource.case.edu</h3>

<p>A few friends and I thought it would be a great idea for people at the
university to have a central service that hosted projects. We deployed
an instance of <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> at
opensource.case.edu (which was initially hosted on my personal Linux desktop
machine). Students, staff, and faculty slowly but surely added projects there.
Keep in mind this was before Github, when SourceForge was king. But, with
SourceForge, you couldn't integrate with the university's authentication
system, easily show community involvement, etc.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after I left the university, the server opensource.case.edu
was hosted on had a catastrophic hardware failure and data was lost and the
service is no longer available. I had transitioned ownership of the site before
that happened, so I like to think that the data loss was not my fault.</p>

<h3>Undergraduate Student Government</h3>

<p>I was part of a small team hired by Undergraduate Student Government to
implement web site features for that group. This included an election
voting system and a custom management system used by members of USG to help
them organize bills, events, etc.</p>

<h3>Course Review Statistics</h3>

<p>At the time I was at the university, there was a very crude system in place
for performing course and instructor evaluations. During class, students would
fill out cards with a #2 pencil with rankings of various aspects of the course
and instructor. These were compiled by the university and made available as
text files on a central server. These were exposed through a web site with
only a crude search interface.</p>

<p>I wrote a tool that scraped all data (I believe it went back 10+ years),
imported it into a database, then exposed the data, complete with pretty
graphs, via a web site. This alone was a major improvement over the existing
system. From there, I built out extra features, such as aggregation of an
individual instructor's ratings over all courses, including all of time. This
made it easier for students to determine which instructors were likely to
teach better and thus what course offering to sign up for.</p>

<p>Feedback was generally positive, especially from the students. However,
some didn't care for the site because it exposed information they didn't want
to see (the graph of average ratings per department apparently drew the
attention of the administration). Some wanted me to take down the site. But,
I argued that I was just using the data already available by the university in
new and creative ways. With backing from USG, I won out.</p>
