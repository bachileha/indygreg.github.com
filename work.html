<h1>Body of Work</h1>

<i>Last updated May 13, 2011</i>

<p>This page contains information on my technical history. You can think of it
as a very descriptive resume.</p>

<h2>The College Years (2002-2006)</h2>

<p>In my 4 years at Case Western Reserve University, I dabbled into a number
of small projects and contributed to a few larger ones. Most of my efforts
were primarily focused on projects related to the university, but some
impacted people outside.</p>

<h3>Case Wiki and Related Extensions</h3>

<p>As a student employee of the university's IT team, I was responsible for
rolling at the <a href="http://wiki.case.edu/">Case Wiki</a>, a central and
unified wiki for the university. A designer prototyped the layout and I
created a MediaWiki skin for it.</p>

<p>While maintaining the wiki, I developed numerous MediaWiki extensions.
These were all released as open source. These extensions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>WikiFeeds - Provided enhanced ATOM and RSS feeds for MediaWiki. Provided
    a secure feed for an individual's watchlist. Many of the features have
    slowly been incorporated into the official MediaWiki code base. But, they
    were exclusive to WikiFeeds for years.</li>
  <li>OpenSearch - Provided OpenSearch support for MediaWiki. OpenSearch has
    since been incorporated into MediaWiki.</li>
  <li>Graph Data Structure and Visualization - Implemented a MediaWiki library
    to create graph data structures from wiki content (e.g. articles are nodes,
    links, etc are edges). Wrote an extension that turned this structure into
    Graphviz markup and rendered it into pages. Also wrote an extension for
    Touchgraph visualization of the same data.</li>
  <li>AJAX Watcher - Exposed real-time wiki changes without page refreshing via
    AJAX calls. I believe MediaWiki has since incorporated something similar.
    </li>
  <li>Farmer - Turns MediaWiki into a wiki farm from a single install.</li>
</ul>

<h3>University Single Sign-On</h3>

<p>While working for the university, I deployed
<a href="http://www.jasig.org/cas">CAS</a> as a single sign-on service for
the entire university. Previous to its rollout, individual sites were taking
login credentials from HTML forms, HTTP basic auth, etc and trying to log in
to the university's LDAP server.</p>

<p>Initially, very few services used CAS. Over time, more and more people
got on board and I'm pretty sure that now almost every site at the university
uses it.</p>

<h3>opensource.case.edu</h3>

<p>A few friends and I thought it would be a great idea for people at the
university to have a central service that hosted projects. We deployed
an instance of <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> at
opensource.case.edu (which was initially hosted on my personal Linux desktop
machine). Students, staff, and faculty slowly but surely added projects there.
Keep in mind this was before Github, when SourceForge was king. But, with
SourceForge, you couldn't integrate with the university's authentication
system, easily show community involvement, etc.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after I left the university, the server opensource.case.edu
was hosted on had a catastrophic hardware failure and data was lost and the
service is no longer available. I had transitioned ownership of the site before
that happened, so I like to think that the data loss was not my fault.</p>

<h3>Undergraduate Student Government</h3>

<p>I was part of a small team hired by Undergraduate Student Government to
implement web site features for that group. This included an election
voting system and a custom management system used by members of USG to help
them organize bills, events, etc.</p>

<h3>Course Review Statistics</h3>

<p>At the time I was at the university, there was a very crude system in place
for performing course and instructor evaluations. During class, students would
fill out cards with a #2 pencil with rankings of various aspects of the course
and instructor. These were compiled by the university and made available as
text files on a central server. These were exposed through a web site with
only a crude search interface.</p>

<p>I wrote a tool that scraped all data (I believe it went back 10+ years),
imported it into a database, then exposed the data, complete with pretty
graphs, via a web site. This alone was a major improvement over the existing
system. From there, I built out extra features, such as aggregation of an
individual instructor's ratings over all courses, including all of time. This
made it easier for students to determine which instructors were likely to
teach better and thus what course offering to sign up for.</p>

<p>Feedback was generally positive, especially from the students. However,
some didn't care for the site because it exposed information they didn't want
to see (the graph of average ratings per department apparently drew the
attention of the administration). Some wanted me to take down the site. But,
I argued that I was just using the data already available by the university in
new and creative ways. With backing from USG, I won out.</p>

<h2>Tellme / Microsoft (Summer 2006, January 2007 - June 2010)</h3>

<p>During my summer break senior year in college, I was an intern at Tellme
Networks, which at the time was a successful startup in the speech recognition
and telephone space. I loved every minute of it.</p>

<h3>VoIP Telephone Provisioning</h3>

<p>My summer internship project was to design and implement a provisioning
system for VoIP telephones. The system consisted of a dynamic TFTP server
(I rolled my own TFTP server because no TFTP servers had dynamic hooks and
the protocol is very simple to implement), dynamic HTTP server to process
requests from telephones, a backend store, and a web administration interface.
</p>

<p>When completed, one could simply plug in any supported Cisco or Polycom
VoIP telephone into the ethernet network and the phone would download the
latest firmware and bootstrap with a suitable configuration. For phones that
weren't provisioned, their initial configuration was configured to dial a
VXML application hosted on Tellme's platform when the receiver was lifted.
This application talked to the company LDAP server, prompted the person for
his or her name, looked up information in the directory, and updated the phone
provisioning system with the information. The phone would then reboot, picking
up the user's configuration, complete with saved dialing preferences, etc.</p>

<p>By far the coolest feature of the system was the ability via the admin
interface to remotely reboot all connected phones. Combined with a custom
bootup chime and an open office space, it was quite amusing listening to 20+
phones play simple jingles simultaneously!</p>

<p>I must have done a good job with the project and generally impressed people,
because I was given a full-time offer at the end of my internship. I accepted,
finished my senior year at college, and started full-time at Tellme in January
2007.</p>

<h3>www.tellme.com and m.tellme.com</h3>

<p>At one time, I was maintaining www.tellme.com and m.tellme.com. These were
both written in PHP and were utilizing the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">
Zend Framework</a>. Although, since 90%+ of the content on www.tellme.com was
static, there was aggressive caching in place such that most page views did
not involve much PHP, keeping server load down. As part of this role, I worked
closely with the creative team for designs and graphics and with marketing to
manage content.</p>

<p>At one time m.tellme.com hosted a download component for Tellme's mobile
application, which ran on most BlackBerry devices and other misc phones. One
of the most frustrating experiences I have had to date was verifying that the
site worked on all these devices. Each device had different support for
rendering web sites. On top of that, you were dealing with different
resolutions. Keep in mind this was before modern browsers came to mobile
devices. Supporting these all concurrently was a real chore. Even the
identification part was a nightmare, as phones could only usually be identified
by the User-Agent HTTP request header or by the presence of some other
non-standard header. And, this wasn't always consistent across carriers or
guaranteed. What a nightmare! I'm glad I don't have to worry about this
any more.</p>

<p>Since the assimilation of Tellme by Microsoft, www.tellme.com and
m.tellme.com are no longer available. Fortunately, the Internet Archive
<a href="http://replay.web.archive.org/20100523111225/http://www.tellme.com/">
contains</a> a semi-working snapshot.</p>

<h3>Deployment of Subversion</h3>

<p>When I started at Tellme, CVS was the lone version control system for
engineering. (I even think one group was still on RCS!) I asked around
about why a more modern version control system wasn't in use, and nobody
seemed to have a good answer (I think the common answer was "because nobody
has set one up").</p>

<p>After consulting a lot of peers, it was decided that Subversion was the
best fit for a new, supported VCS. It wasn't that Subversion was the best
of breed (I believe Perforce arguably was at the time). It was chosen because
it was very similar to CVS (their motto at the time was <i>a compelling
replacement for CVS</i>), it was free and open source, and had a great hooks
system.</p>

<p>I worked with the operations team to deploy Subversion and announced it to
the company. Slowly but surely, people started using it. Usage increased
dramtically after I did a brownbag presentation on Subversion and its merits
over CVS and I started to roll out custom hooks to supplement functionality.
Teams loved the ability to receive emails on commits, close bugs (via a
special syntax in the commit messages), require buddies on commit (also via
special syntax in commit messages). This all required special commit hooks,
of course. Unfortunately, those were developed after Tellme became Microsoft,
so they will likely never see light outside company walls.</p>

<p>At some point, I lobbied someone in the engineering org to splurge for a new
server for hosting the source code services. I worked with the operations team
to get that installed. And, I received a lot of hacker cred for making the
version control systems 5x faster (which was a big deal for some of the teams,
with their large trees that took a couple of minutes to switch branches with
CVS).</p>

<h3>Weekly Brownbags</h3>

<p>At some point in my time at Tellme/Microsoft, I organized a weekly brown
bag series. Every Wednesday, individuals or small groups would present topics
to whoever was in attendence. These were often engineer-centric, but anyone
could and did present.</p>

<p>I seeded the sessions with presentations by myself and a few select people.
After that, I either had people contact me to be added to the calendar or I
sought out and encouraged people to present. Every week, I also recorded
the sessions and made them available on the intranet.</p>

<h3>Web-Based Code Review System</h3>

<p>I believe sometime in 2009, I grew frustrated with the way we were doing
code reviews. The act of looking at plain text diffs and recording comments
in email or similar just felt out-dated. When others felt the same, I started
researching solutions. I heard Google had a pretty nifty one, but it was only
partially available to the public. I decided on <a href="http://www.reviewboard.org/">
Review Board</a> and deployed it. It became an overnight success with almost
immediate adoption by every team. Great tool.</p>

<h3>Go-To Person</h3>

<p>In my time at Tellme/Microsoft, I became a go-to person in the org for
questions on Perl, mod_perl, Apache HTTP Server, compiling packages, and
other misc topics. The first two sort of scared me at the time because when I
started at Tellme, I knew almost nothing about Perl. Somehow, I became good
enough that I could dole out advice and answers and know what I was doing in
code reviews.</p>

<p>For the Apache HTTP Server, I was very familiar with the internals, since I
wrote a couple of C modules while at Tellme. As such, all the weird bugs or
questions about server behavior seemed to always come my way. When a team was
deploying a new site or service, I would often be the one reviewing the
configs or lending advice on how to configure it.</p>

<p>For compiling packages, I always took satisfaction out of wrangling things
to compile on Solaris x86 (although, we ran a typical GNU toolchain as opposed
to the Sun stack, so it wasn't as bad as it sounds). I was also pretty adamant
about packages being built properly (e.g. considering which libraries were
statically and dynamically linked, defining proper linker flags to foster
easier linking in the future, getting an optimized binary, etc). So, people
would often come to me and ask me to review the compilation procedure.</p>

<h3>Server Management</h3>

<p>For most of my time at Tellme, I was a member of an about 15 person team
which wrote and maintained many of the Tellme/Microsoft-branded VXML
applications and the services they directly required. (VXML applications often
consist of static VXML documents and dynamic web services with which they
talk at run-time.) One of my major roles on the team was managing the servers
these resided on.</p>

<p>This role involved numerous responsibilities. First, I needed to be
familiar with all aspects of the dynamic services so I would know how to
triage them, make informed decisions about scalability, etc. I was often
developing these services myself. When I wasn't, I typically became informed
by being part of the code reviews. I would often address concerns around
scalability and failure, such as timeouts to remote services, expected
latency, ensuring adequate monitors were present and tested, etc.</p>

<p>Once the services were in my court, I needed to figure out where to host
them. We had a number of different server pools from which to choose. Or,
there was always the option of buying new hardware, but you want to keep
costs down whenever possible, of course. I had to take into consideration the
expected load, security requirements, network ACL connectivity requirements,
technology requirements, etc. This was always a complicated juggling act. But,
people knew that I would get it done and things would just work.</p>

<p>As part of this role, I interacted closely with the operations team and
the NOC. The operations team would be involved whenever new servers were
needed, new ACLs were to be deployed, etc. At a large company, this was often
a formal process, which required working with various project and product
managers, navigating political waters, etc. I could talk the lingo with the
operations people, so having me always act as the go-between was effective at
gettings things done. As for the NOC, they were involved any time we changed
anything. The operations mindset is to achieve 99.999% uptime on
everything. As part of that, any change is communicated and planned well in
advance along with the exact procedure to be performed. I knew most of the
individuals in the NOC and they knew me.</p>

<h3>Logging System Improvements</h3>

<p>Sometime in 2009, I set out to make improvements to Tellme's proprietary
event logging and transport infrastructure. The first part of this involved
writing a new C library that performed writing. When I started, there existed
the initial C++ implementation and feature-minimal implementations in Perl
and a few other languages. However, the C++ implementation required a sizeable
number of external dependencies (on the order of 40MB) and interop with C
was difficult. People in C land found themselves in dependency hell and were
cursing the computer gods.</p>

<p>I implemented a C library from scratch, using the C++ code as a guide, but
only for the low-level details of the protocol, which weren't documented
well outside of the code. The initial version only supported writing. It
was free of external dependencies, compiled on both Solaris and Windows, and
weighed in at a svelt 50kB.</p>

<p>A few months later, an individual came to me and said something along the
lines of, "I really love the simplicity of your library. But, I need to perform
reading. Can you help me?" So, I implemented reading support in the library.
It turned out that the reading library was much more efficient than the C++
one. And, for what my colleague was using it for (iterating over hundreds of
gigabytes of data), this made a huge difference! What followed was a lot of
low-level performance optimization to maximize the reading throughput of the
library. A stack instead of dynamic allocation here, a register variable
there, all contributed to significant performance improvements to the already
insanely fast library. Towards the end, we were in the territory of the x86
calling convention hurting us more than any other part.</p>

<p>I achieved great satisfaction on this project. And, a lot of it was after
it was complete (and I had even left the company). People were using the
library in ways I had not foreseen (like in C# or on non-server devices). There
was even talk of shipping the library as part of an external release, which
never would have been possible with the C++ version because it linked to open
source software and Microsoft is very sensitive to that (sadly). A few months
after I left the company, somebody emailed me and said something along the
lines of, "your XXX library is the best C library I have ever seen. I wish
all C libraries were this easy to use and would 'just work.'" Sadly, the
library is Microsoft IP, so I can't share it with you. But, I can refer you
to people who have used it!</p>

<h2>Xobni (July 2010 - May 2011)</h2>

<p>It is my understanding that Xobni hired me to bring experience to their
at-the-time frail cloud system, Xobni One (now known as Xobni Cloud). When I
joined, their operations procedures seemed like they were out of the wild west
(at least this was my perspective come from Tellme/Microsoft). System
monitoring for the product I was to beef up consisted of someone looking at
some Graphite graphs, noticing a change in the pattern, and investigating.
We could do better.</p>

<h3>Better Monitoring</h3>

<p>One of my first acts at Xobni was to deploy a real monitoring system. We
decided on <a href="http://www.opsview.com/">Opsview</a> because it is built
on top of Nagios, a popular and well-known monitoring system (although not
one without its flaws) and offers a compelling front-end for managing Nagios,
which is typically a real chore.</p>

<p>I set up Opsview on a central host, deployed NRPE on all the hosts, and
started monitoring. Email alerts were configured and all were happy we now
knew in near real time when stuff was breaking. At one point, I even had a
custom Nagios notification script that used the Twilio API to call people
with alert info. But, we didn't pursue that further. Cool idea, though!</p>
