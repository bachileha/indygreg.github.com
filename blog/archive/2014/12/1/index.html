  <p><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mach/">mach</a> - the generic command line
dispatching tool that powers the <strong>mach</strong> command to aid Firefox
development - now has support for sub-commands.</p>
<p>You can now create simple and intuitive user interfaces involving
sub-actions. e.g.</p>
<pre><code>mach device sync
mach device run
mach device delete
</code></pre>
<p>Before, to do something like this would require a universal argument
parser or separate mach commands. Both constitute a poor user
experience (confusing array of available arguments or proliferation of
top-level commands). Both result in <em>mach help</em> being difficult to
comprehend. And that's not good for usability and approachability.</p>
<p>Nothing in Firefox currently uses this feature. Although there is an
in-progress patch in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1108293">bug 1108293</a>
for providing a mach command to analyze C/C++ build dependencies.
It is my hope that others write useful commands and functionality
on top of this feature.</p>
<p>The documentation for mach has also been rewritten. It is now
<a href="https://ci.mozilla.org/job/mozilla-central-docs/Tree_Documentation/python/mach/index.html">exposed</a>
as part of the in-tree Sphinx documentation.</p>
<p>Everyone should thank <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/ahal/">Andrew Halberstadt</a>
for promptly reviewing the changes!</p>

  <p>Today was one crazy day.</p>
<p>The build peers all sat down with Release Engineering and Axel Hecht
to talk l10n packaging. <a href="http://glandium.org/">Mike Hommey</a> has a
Q1 goal to fix l10n packaging. There is buy-in from Release
Engineering on enabling him in his quest to slay dragons. This
will make builds faster and will pay off a massive mountain of
technical debt that plagues multiple groups at Mozilla.</p>
<p>The Firefox build system contributors sat down with a bunch of
Rust people and we talked about what it would take to integrate
Rust into the Firefox build system and the path towards shipping
a Rust component in Firefox. It sounds like that is going to
happen in 2015 (although we're not yet sure what component will
be written in Rust). I consider it an achievement that the gathering
of both groups didn't result in infinite rabbit holing about
system architectures, toolchains, and the build people telling
<em>horror stories</em> to wide-eyed Rust people about the crazy things
we have to do to build and ship Firefox. Believe me, the
temptation was there.</p>
<p>People interested in the build system all sat down and reflected on
the state of the build system and where we want to go. We agreed
to create a build mode optimized for non-Gecko developers
that downloads pre-built binaries - avoiding ~10 minutes of
C/C++ compile time for builds. Mark my words, this will be one
of those changes that once deployed will cause people to say
"I can't believe we went so long without this."</p>
<p>I joined Mark Côté and others to talk about priorities for
MozReview. We'll be making major improvements to the UX and
integrating static analysis into reviews. Push a patch for
review and have machines do some of the work that humans are
currently doing! We're tentatively planning a get-together in
Toronto in January to sprint towards awesomeness.</p>
<p>I ended the day by giving a long and rambling presentation about
version control, with emphasis on Mercurial. I can't help but
feel that I talked way too much. There's just so much knowledge
to cover. A few people told me afterwards they learned a lot. I'd
appreciate feedback if you attended. Anyway, I got a few nods
from people as I was saying some somewhat contentious things.
It's always good to have validation that I'm not on an island
when I say crazy things.</p>
<p>I hope to spend Friday chasing down loose ends from the week.
This includes talking to some security gurus about another crazy
idea of mine to integrate PGP into the code review and code
landing workflow for Firefox. I'll share more details once
I get a professional opinion on the security front.</p>

  <p>You may have noticed the Firefox trees
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1107156">were closed</a>
for the better part of yesterday.</p>
<p>Long story short, a file containing URLs for Firefox installers was
updated to reference https://ftp.mozilla.org/ from
http://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/. The original, latter
host is a CDN. The former is not. When thousands of clients started
hitting ftp.mozilla.org, it overwhelmed the servers and network,
causing timeouts and other badness.</p>
<p>The change in question was accidental. It went through code review.
From a code change standpoint, procedures were followed.</p>
<p>It is tempting to point fingers at the people involved. However, I
want us to consider placing blame elsewhere: on the code review
tool.</p>
<p>The diff being reviewed was to change the Firefox version number
from 32.0 to 32.0.3. If you were asked to review this
patch, I'm guessing your eyes would have glanced over everything in the
URL except the version number part. I'm pretty sure mine would have.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at what the reviewer saw in Bugzilla/Splinter (click
to see full size):</p>
<p><a href="/images/intraline-splinter.png">
<img src="/images/intraline-splinter.png" width="600" />
</a></p>
<p>And here is what the reviewer would have seen had the review been
conducted in MozReview:</p>
<p><a href="/images/intraline-reviewboard.png">
<img src="/images/intraline-reviewboard.png" width="600">
</a></p>
<p>Which tool makes the change of hostname more obvious? Bugzilla/Splinter
or MozReview?</p>
<p><strong>MozReview's support for intraline diffs more clearly draws attention to
the hostname change. I posit that had this patch been reviewed with
MozReview, the chances are greater we wouldn't have had a network
outage yesterday.</strong></p>
<p>And it isn't just intraline diffs that make Splinter/Bugzilla a
sub-optimal code review tool. I recently blogged about the
<a href="/blog/2014/10/27/implications-of-using-bugzilla-for-firefox-patch-development/">numerous ways that using Bugzilla for code revie results in harder
reviews and buggier
code</a>.
Every day we continue using Bugzilla/Splinter instead of investing in
better code review tools is a day severe bugs like this can and will
slip through the cracks.</p>
<p>If there is any silver lining to this outage, I hope it is that we need
to double down on our investment in developer tools, particularly code
review.</p>
