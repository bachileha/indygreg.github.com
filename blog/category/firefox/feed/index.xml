      <description>Changes to How mach Loads mozconfigs</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you use mach to build Firefox, there is a chance you may run into
some errors from a change that landed on mozilla-central Wednesday.</p>
<p>I reimplemented the mozconfig finding and loading logic in Python and
with a nice shell wrapper that lets us more easily inspect side-effects
of execution. The overall goal is to speed up mozconfig loading (fewer
shell invocations) as well as to have a strong API for interacting with
mozconfigs so we can do things like better validation. As a side effect,
we now have test coverage of mozconfig behavior!</p>
<p>Anyway, because the logic for mozconfig finding and loading is going
through a completely new mechanism, you may notice some weird behavior.
Until a few minutes ago, $topsrcdir wasn't defined in the execution
environment. This is now fixed. I think most complaints stemmed from
this.</p>
<p>Another significant change is that mozconfig shell scripts are now
executed in a shell that has <em>set -e</em>. This means that failing commands
in your mozconfig will now abort execution. Before, execution would have
silently continued unless you checked the exit code in your mozconfig.
I think this is a change for the better, but it may break your
mozconfigs.</p>
<p>If you encounter an issue, please follow the instructions in mach's
output to file a bug. Please attach or link to your mozconfig.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Firefox Build System Presentation</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case you missed it, I gave a presentation on the state of Firefox's
build system yesterday.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://air.mozilla.org/the-future-of-the-firefox-build-system/">watch</a>
it and <a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/presentations/2012-11-29-firefox-build-system/#1">view</a>
the slides online.</p>
<p>If you build Firefox from source regularly, you should definitely at
least skim through the slide deck.</p>
<p>I'm not an HTML expert, so my apogolies for bad UI on the interactive
slides. You may need to press <strong>enter</strong> to select items in
dropdown menus. Also, the interactive slides are a bit resource
intensive. If the slide deck is really slow, turn off those elements.
I've also only tested the slides in Firefox 19 and 20. My apologies if
they don't work everywhere.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Mach Has Landed</title>
      <link>http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/09/26/mach-has-landed</link>

      <description>Mach Has Landed</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hacking on Firefox is <em>hard</em>. Compiling the source tree for the first
time is a daunting experience. If you manage to do that, you still need
to figure out how to submit patches, write and run tests, etc. There is
no shortage of points where people can get confused, make mistakes, or
just give up because the barrier is too high.</p>
<p>I have strong convictions about making the overall developer experience
better (developers are users too, after all). The easier you make the
developer experience, the greater the chances of retaining developers.
And retaining developers means more contributions: more features and
fewer bugs. This translates to a better state for the Mozilla Project.
This makes the world a better place.</p>
<p>Since practically my first day working at Mozilla, I've been
experimenting with ways to make contributing to Firefox easier by
improving the build system or interaction with it.</p>
<p>With a lot of help, I've finally succeeded in landing something into the
Firefox source tree that I think will ultimately lead to a much better
developer experience.</p>
<p>It's called <strong>mach</strong> (German for <em>do</em>) and if you pull the latest
version of <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central">mozilla-central</a>
(Firefox's main source code repository), you can run mach today.</p>
<h2>Running Mach</h2>
<p>You can run Mach by simply executing it from the root directory in the
repository:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./mach
</code></pre>
<p>Ideally, I shouldn't have to tell you anything else: mach's output
should provide you all the instruction you need to use it. If it
doesn't, that is a bug and it should be fixed.</p>
<p>Realistically, mach is still in early development and its user
experience still leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>Because technical usage docs belong in a medium that is easily
discoverable and where the community can improve on them (not a
post on a personal blog), you can find additional usage information in
the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Developer_Guide/mach">mach article</a> on
MDN. The
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/python/mach/README.rst">mach README</a>
holds more technical information for people wanting to poke at the inner
workings.</p>
<p>Mach does require Python 2.7. The build system will likely soon require
Python 2.7 as well. So, if you don't have Python 2.7, you should upgrade
now before you lose the ability to build the tree. Conveniently, the
tree now has a
<a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/09/18/bootstrap-your-system-to-build-firefox">bootstrap script</a>
which covers the installation of Python. So, Python 2.7 should just be a
simple command away.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Why would you use mach? Good question! Compared to the existing
out-of-the-box experience, mach adds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to run xpcshell and mochitest tests from the source directory.
  This means you can tab-complete test filenames in your shell and it
  <em>just works</em>.</li>
<li>Parsing of compiler warnings (currently supports Clang 3.1 and MSVC
  formats) into a unified warnings database (actually a JSON file).
  After builds you can run <em>./mach warnings-list</em> or <em>./mach
  warnings-summary</em> to get a concise list without having to look at
  build logs.</li>
<li>A single command-line interface where you can easily discover new
  functionality. Just run <em>./mach help</em> (try doing that with make!).</li>
</ul>
<p>Naysayers will say this is a paltry list. They are correct. I have
bigger plans. But, you have to start somewhere.</p>
<h2>Goals and Future Ideas</h2>
<p>The overall goal of mach is to improve the developer experience of
developing Firefox and other Gecko applications. It does this by
providing a convenient, central command in the root directory of
the repository that acts as both an oracle to discover new commands
and functionality (<em>./mach help</em>) as well as a proxy to execute them.
You don't need to worry about environment variables, working directories,
or finding some random script hidden in the bowells of the source tree.
You just run a single command and the world is brought to you. No build
documentation. No outdated wikis. No copying commands into your shell.
No having to scour random blogs for useful tools. You just clone the
repository, run a command, see what you can do, and get stuff done. Your
shell-literate grandmother could do it.</p>
<p>Mach should be your springboard to in-tree developer tools and increased
productivity. You shouldn't need anything except a copy of the source
tree and mach.</p>
<p>Like Git and Mercurial, mach is powered by the concept of
sub-commands/actions. So, one simply needs to register a new sub-command
with the mach driver. This involves writing a Python class. Once you do
that, people can discover and use that functionality. All batteries are
included with a copy of mozilla-central.</p>
<p>As stated above, the current set of commands is rather small. But, the
sky is the limit. Here are some of my ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to upload, download, and apply patches from Bugzilla (Burak
  YiÄŸit Kaya, Jeff Hammel, Clint Talbert and I have already talked about
  this -- progress tracked in
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774141">bug 774141</a>).</li>
<li>Automatically configure Mercurial with optimal settings (ensure user
  info is set, proper lines of diff context, enable mqext, etc). Tracked
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=794580">bug 794580</a>.</li>
<li>Submit Try builds. The <a href="https://github.com/pbiggar/trychooser">trychooser</a>
  Mercurial extension could easily live as a mach subcommand! Tracked in
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774137">bug 774137</a>.</li>
<li>Identify Bugzilla components and/or reviewers from files touched by
  patch. It's all in the history of the touched files and the history of
  the old bugs referenced by those commits!
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774145">Bug 774145</a>.</li>
<li>Interaction with the <em>self-serve</em> build API. That thing on TBPL to
  control individual builds - we could make a CLI interface for it.
  (Steve Fink and/or Jeff Hammel already have
  <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/josh_joshmatthews.net/self-serve-tools">code</a>
  for this - it just needs to be integrated).
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774147">Bug 774147</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an idea for a feature, please
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;component=mach">file a bug</a>.
Please note there are many features on file already. However, some
obvious ones such as integration with missing test suites have yet to be
filed (at least at the time I wrote this post).</p>
<p>If you wrote an awesome developer tool and would like others to use it
(without having to rely on people discovering it by reading a corner of the
Internet), add it to mach! Use mach as a wedge to get more exposure and
users. File a bug. I will happily r+ patches that add useful developer
functionality to the tree.</p>
<h2>What this Means / Longer Term Future</h2>
<p>While there is no timetable, mach will eventually replace <em>client.mk</em>.
client.mk, like mach, is essentially a CLI driver for the build
system. Having the driver implemented in Python rather than make has many
compelling advantages. I could probably write a whole post on it, but
I'll spare the world from my ranting.</p>
<p>Anyway, this all means that you may want to start re-training your
muscle memory now. Stop typing <em>make</em> and start typing <em>mach</em>. If you
need to type <em>make</em> because mach does not provide a feature, this is a
missing feature from mach.
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;component=mach">File a bug</a>
and request a new mach feature!</p>
<p>I want to condition people to stop typing <em>make</em>, especially in the object
directory. There are drastic changes to the build system in the works
(<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=784841">bug 784841</a> is
the tip of the iceburg). These changes will require the build system to
be treated as a black box. So, things like invoking make from the object
directory will eventually break. You'll need to go through an
intelligent tool to invoke the build system. Mach will be that tool.</p>
<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>I would like to single out the following individuals for helping to land
mach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jeff Hammel for doing the bulk of the reviewing. He shares my vision
  for mach and how it will make the overall developer experience much
  more pleasant and how this will translate to better things for The
  Project. In my mind, Jeff deserves as much credit for landing mach as
  I do.</li>
<li>Mike Hommey and Ms2ger for review help. Mike Hommey helped identify a
  lot of issues with build system integration. Ms2ger provided lots of
  general feedback on Python issues and API design.</li>
<li>Mike Connor (my manager) for allowing me to work on this. It's not
  related to my job description in any way so he <em>could</em> say I shouldn't
  be spending time on this. But, he realizes the positive impact this can
  have and has been supportive of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you find mach useful!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Bootstrap Your System to Build Firefox</title>

      <description>Bootstrap Your System to Build Firefox</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you've looked at the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Simple_Firefox_build">build instructions</a>
for Firefox lately, you may have noticed something new: support for
system bootstrapping!</p>
<p>Now checked in to mozilla-central is a
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/python/mozboot/">framework</a>
for ensuring your system is capable of building mozilla-central and
Firefox. You just need to download and run a single Python script and it
performs magic.</p>
<p>Kudos go out to a community contributor, kmm (name wasn't revealed) for
doing the legwork for tracking down and verifying things worked on all
the Linux distros. Richard Newman and Jeff Hammel also helped with code
reviews. Just hours after it landed, Landry Breuil contributed support
for OpenBSD!</p>
<p>Currently, bootstrapping works for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu Linux</li>
<li>Mint</li>
<li>CentOS 6.x</li>
<li>Fedora</li>
<li>OS X 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8</li>
<li>OpenBSD</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to add support for an additional OS, please file a
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;component=Build%20Config">Core : Build Config</a>
bug. Likewise, if you encounter an issue, please file a bug so others
don't get tripped up by it!</p>
<p>Bootstrap support is definitely in its infancy. It still needs features
like better prompting and opportunities for user choice (e.g. support
MacPorts on OS X - currently it only works with Homebrew). But, I think
it is much better than what existed previously, especially on OS X.</p>
<p>I consider this bootstrapping component just one piece in a larger
mission to make developing and building Firefox (and other Gecko
applications) easier. This should (hopefully) lead to more development
involvement. The next component to land will likely be
<a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/07/25/mozilla-build-system-plan-of-attack">mach</a>.
It's (finally) been getting some review love (thanks Jeff Hammel!), so
I'm optimistic it will land in the next few weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Visual Studio Project Generation for mozilla-central</title>
      <link>http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/08/28/visual-studio-project-generation-for-mozilla-central</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Aug 2012 12:00:00 PDT</pubDate>

      <description>Visual Studio Project Generation for mozilla-central</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have very alpha support for Visual Studio project generation for
mozilla-central that daring people can dogfood.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that this is extremely alpha. Normally, I wouldn't
release things as fragile as they are. But, I know Windows developers
sorely miss Visual Studio, especially IntelliSense. The current Visual
Studio projects support IntelliSense, so I want to get this in the hands
of Windows developers ASAP.</p>
<p>The current directions for making this all work are a bit hacky. Things
will change once things have matured. For now, please excuse the mess.</p>
<p>First, you will need to grab the code. If you use Git, set up a remote
to my repository:</p>
<pre><code>git remote add indygreg git://github.com/indygreg/mozilla-central.git
git fetch indygreg
</code></pre>
<p>The branch of interest is <em>build-splendid</em>. I periodically rebase this
branch on top of master. You have been warned.</p>
<p>You can switch to this branch:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b build-splendid indygreg/build-splendid
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can squash it down to a single commit and merge it
into your local branch. Once you've done that, you can record the SHA-1
of the commit and cherry-pick that wherever you like!</p>
<pre><code>git merge --squash indygreg/build-splendid
git commit
</code></pre>
<p>In the current state, you need to build the tree or the Visual Studio
projects will complain about missing files. It doesn't matter if you
build the tree before or after Visual Studio projects are generated.
But, we might as well get it out of the way. From your MozillaBuild
environment, run:</p>
<pre><code>./mach build
</code></pre>
<p>That should <em>just work</em>. If it doesn't, you may need to configure
mach.ini. See my <a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/08/15/build-firefox-faster-with-build-splendid/">previous post</a>
on how to configure mach.ini. As a reference, my Windows config is:</p>
<pre><code>[build]

configure_extra = --disable-webgl

[compiler]

[paths]
source_directory = c:\dev\src\mozilla-central-git
object_directory = c:\dev\src\mozilla-central-git\objdir
</code></pre>
<p>Now, to generate Visual Studio project files:</p>
<pre><code>./mach backendconfig visualstudio
</code></pre>
<p>That should take about a minute to finish. When it's done, it should
have created <em>objdir/msvc/mozilla.sln</em>. You should be able to load that
in Visual Studio!</p>
<p>You will need to regenerate Visual Studio project files when the build
config changes. As a rule of thumb, do this every time you pull source.
You don't need to perform a full build before you generate Visual Studio
files (you do need to perform configure, however). However, if you have
not performed a full build, Visual Studio may not be able to find some
files, like headers generated from IDLs.</p>
<p><strong>Please close the solution before regenerating the project files.</strong> If
you don't, Visual Studio puts up a modal dialog for each project file
that changed and you have to click through over a hundred of these. It's
extremely frustrating. I'm investigating workarounds.</p>
<h2>Current State</h2>
<p>Currently, it only generates projects for C/C++ compilation (libraries).
I still need to add support for IDL, headers, etc. However, each
project has proper compiler flags, header search paths, etc. So,
IntelliSense is happy and some things do manage to compile!</p>
<p>Many parts are broken and sub-par.</p>
<p>I've only tested on Visual Studio 2008. If you are running Visual Studio
\2010, you can try to upgrade the solution. This <em>may</em> work. The backend
supports generating solutions for different versions. But, I haven't
tested things work on non-2008 and I don't want to expose untested behavior.</p>
<p>Compiling within Visual Studio works for some things. On my system, I
get a lot of <em>nullptr not defined</em> errors. I'm not sure why. This will
hopefully be worked out soon.</p>
<p>If you do manager to compile within Visual Studio, the output files
don't go in the right places. So, if you do a build from the
command-line, it will have to re-compile to pick up changes.</p>
<p>Project names are based on the name of the library they produce. I'm not
sure if this is the best solution.</p>
<p>Project dependencies are not set up. They will be added later.</p>
<p>Projects for linking libxul or building firefox.exe are not yet
provided. Along the same vein, debugging support is not built-in. I'm
working on it.</p>
<p>Basically, IntelliSense works. You can now use Visual Studio as a rich
editor. Hopefully this is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>I'm anxious to hear if this works for other people. Please leave
comments!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Build Firefox Faster with Build Splendid</title>
      <link>http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/08/15/build-firefox-faster-with-build-splendid</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Aug 2012 14:30:00 PDT</pubDate>

      <description>Build Firefox Faster with Build Splendid</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Would you like to build Firefox faster? If so, do the following:</p>
<pre><code>hg qimport http://people.mozilla.org/~gszorc/build-splendid.patch
hg qpush
rm .mozconfig* (you may want to create a backup first)
./mach build
</code></pre>
<p>This should <em>just work</em> on OS X, Linux, and other Unix-style systems.
<strong>Windows support is currently broken, sorry.</strong></p>
<p><em>mach</em> can do much more than build. Run the following to see what:</p>
<pre><code>./mach --help
</code></pre>
<h2>Important Info</h2>
<p><em>mach</em> replaces client.mk. <em>mach</em> has its own configuration file. The
first time you run <em>mach</em>, it will create the file <em>mach.ini</em> in the
same directory as the <em>mach</em> script. This is your new <em>mozconfig</em> file.</p>
<p>The default <em>mach.ini</em> places the object directory into the directory
<em>objdir</em> under the top source directory. It also builds an optimized
binary without debug info.</p>
<p>Run the following to see which config settings you can add to
<em>mach.ini</em>:</p>
<pre><code>./mach settings-create
./mach settings-list
</code></pre>
<p>This <em>may</em> fail because I'm still working out the kinks with <em>gettext</em>.
If it doesn't work, open <em>python/mozbuild-bs/mozbuild/base.py</em> and search
for <em>_register_settings</em>. Open
<em>python/mozbuild-bs/mozbuild/locale/en-US/LC_MESSAGES/mozbuild.po</em> for
the help messages.</p>
<p>As a point of reference, my <em>mach.ini</em> looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code>[build]
application = browser

configure_extra = --enable-dtrace --enable-tests

[compiler]
cc = /usr/local/llvm/bin/clang
cxx = /usr/local/llvm/bin/clang++

cflags = -fcolor-diagnostics
cxxflags = -fcolor-diagnostics

[paths]
source_directory = /Users/gps/src/mozilla-central-git
object_directory = /Users/gps/src/mozilla-central-git/objdir
</code></pre>
<p>I am on OS X and am using a locally-built version of LLVM/Clang, which I
have installed to <em>/usr/local/llvm</em>.</p>
<p>You'll notice there are no options to configure make. The patch
automatically selects optimal settings for your platform!</p>
<h2>Known Issues and Caveats</h2>
<p>This is alpha. It works in scenarios in which I have tested it, mainly
building the <em>browser</em> application on OS X and Linux. There are many
features missing and likely many bugs.</p>
<p>I have been using this as part of my day-to-day development for weeks.
However, your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>As stated above, Windows support is lacking. It will appear to work, but
things will blow up during building. Don't even try to use it on
Windows.</p>
<p>There are likely many bugs. Please don't file Bugzilla bugs, as this
isn't part of the build system just yet.</p>
<p><strong>This patch takes over the build system. Do not attempt to use
client.mk or run make directly with this patch applied.</strong></p>
<p>If you encounter an issue, your methods of recourse are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Post a comment on this blog post</li>
<li>Ping me on irc.mozilla.org. My nick is <em>gps</em>. Try the #buildfaster
   channel.</li>
<li>Send an email to gps@mozilla.com</li>
</ol>
<p>I am particularly interested in exceptions and build failures.</p>
<p>If you encounter an issue building with this, just reverse the patch and
build like you have always done (don't forget to restore your mozconfig
file).</p>
<p>If <em>mach.ini</em> does not support everything you were doing in your
mozconfig, please send me a copy of your mozconfig so I can implement
whatever you need.</p>
<h2>Other Info</h2>
<p>I will likely write a follow-up post detailing what's going on. If you
are curious, the code lives in <em>python/mozbuild-bs</em>. The <em>backend</em> and
<em>frontend</em> sub-packages are where the magic is at. Once the backend has
been configured, check out <em>hybridmake.mk</em> and all of the <em>splendid.mk</em>
files in the object directory.</p>
<p>I am particularly interested in the real-world impact of this patch on
people's build times. In this early version of the patch, you likely
won't see drastic speed increases. On my MacBook Pro with an SSD, I see
end-to-end clobber build times decrease by over a minute. With a little
more work, I should be able to shave another minute or two off of that.</p>
<p>I will try to keep the patch up-to-date as I improve the build system.
Refresh early and often.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>One Year at Mozilla</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is hard to believe that my first day as a full-time employee of Mozilla
was one year ago today! But, here I am. And, I'd like to think the past
year is worth reflecting on.</p>
<p>So, what have I been doing for a year? Good question!</p>
<h2>Accomplishments</h2>
<ul>
<li>First patch and commit to Firefox: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=673209">bug 673209</a>.
  Yes, my first patch was to configure.in. It scared me too.</li>
<li>Number of non-merge commits: 133</li>
<li>Number of merge commits: 49</li>
<li>Number of reviews: 31</li>
<li>Favorite commit message: <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/88d02a07d390">88d02a07d390</a>
  <em>Fix bug 725478 because we run a buggy Python released almost 5 years
  ago; r=tigerblood</em> (it was a bustage follow-up).</li>
<li>Biggest mistake: buildbotcustom change to packaging turned every tree
  red. All of them. Including release. I think I have philor on record
  saying it is the worst burnage he's ever seen. Mission accomplished!</li>
</ul>
<p>Major User-Facing Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrote add-on sync for Firefox (with help from many others, especially
  Dave Townsend and Blair McBride).</li>
<li>Principle reviewer for Apps in the Cloud (apps sync) in Firefox. (Are
  reviewers allowed to take credit?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, when I see that list, I think <em>that's all?</em> It doesn't feel
like a lot, especially since I work on a major user-facing feature
(Firefox Sync). I do contribute to more. But, if you ask me what the
most significant impact was, I don't think I can call anything else out
as <em>major</em>.</p>
<p>There are certainly a lot of minor things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually managed to understand how Firefox Sync works, including the
  crypto model. I even <a href="http://docs.services.mozilla.com/sync/storageformat5.html">documented</a>
  it! I don't think I knew any of that when I started (I basically knew
  that Firefox Sync was using strong client-side encryption. What that
  meant, I had no clue.)</li>
<li>Filed initial bugs (including some patches) to compile mozilla-central
  on Windows 8 and MSVC 2011. By the time people started working on
  Metro development, mozilla-build, configure, and the like already
  supported building.</li>
<li>Configured <a href="https://ci.mozilla.org/job/sync-android/">Android Sync Jenkins Builder</a>.
  I'm told the Android Sync team loves it! You gotta love all the
  built-in dashboards. I really wish we had this for mozilla-central.</li>
<li>Made xpcshell test harness write xUnit files. Machine readable output
  of test results, baby!</li>
<li>Implement <em>send tab to device</em> API in Firefox Sync. Too bad we don't
  have UX to use it :(</li>
<li>Implemented testing-only JavaScript modules. So, instead of the hack
  that is [head] files in tests, you can
  <em>Cu.import("resource://testing-common/foo.js");</em></li>
<li>Made test package generation quieter. This made build logs about 30%
  smaller. This means you can get at build results faster.</li>
<li>Hacked around with JavaScript code coverage using the JS Debugger API.
  Failed in the process. But, I learned a lot about the JS Debugger API,
  so I consider it a win.</li>
<li>Rewrote Firefox Sync's record reconciling algorithm. The old one was
  full of subtle data loss corner cases. The new algorithm is much more
  robust (we think - even with 3 reviewers there was still some head
  scratching).</li>
<li>Emancipated lots of generic JavaScript code from the Sync tree into
  the a <em>services-common</em> package. This anticipated Apps in the Cloud
  and notifications' requirement to use this functionality and allowed
  those projects to get going quicker. At this point, we're effectively
  running a mini Toolkit. We really need to port some of this
  <em>upstream</em>.</li>
<li>Helped design the <a href="http://docs.services.mozilla.com/storage/apis-2.0.html">next version</a>
  of the HTTP service to be used by Sync.</li>
<li>Implemented a standalone JavaScript implementation of the above. The
  production server used by Mozilla runs on Python (running the Python
  server in Mozilla's test environment would be too difficult). The
  server was also implemented using just the spec. This allowed us to
  clarify many parts of the spec. The Python functional tests can also
  be executed against the JS server. This gives us confidence that
  functionality is equivalent and tests hitting the test/JS server will
  behave the same as if they are hitting the production Python server.</li>
<li>Implemented a standalone JavaScript
  <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/services/common/storageservice.js">client</a>  for the above service. Previously, all the logic for this was scattered
  over about a dozen files and was notoriously difficult to audit and
  update. I also think it is a decent example of good code.  Clean.
  Highly documented. No hacks.</li>
<li>Reviewed a skeleton for the notifications service, which will
  eventually power browser notifications in Firefox.</li>
<li>Build system patches to better support Clang. Thankfully, Rafael
  EspÃ­ndola has been our Clang champion as of late and is now ensuring
  the bleeding edge of Clang does not break the tree. Thanks, Rafael! (I
  actually think he is in the process of switching our OS X builds to
  use Clang as I type this!)</li>
<li>Worked with security and crypto people to devise the security model
  behind the next version of Firefox Sync. (Brian Warner and Ben Adida
  have been doing most of the crypto work. I'm mostly on the sidelines
  making sure they design a system that can easily interop with Sync.)</li>
<li>Helped devise the <a href="http://docs.services.mozilla.com/sync/storageformat6.html">next version</a>
  of Sync's server-side storage format. This will make the next version
  of Sync faster and able to hold more data at lower server cost.</li>
<li>Gave lots of love to documentation at
  <a href="http://docs.services.mozilla.com/">https://docs.services.mozilla.com/</a>
  (especially the Sync docs). It's almost at the point where others can
  implement Sync clients without having to ask one of the fewer than 10
  people on the planet who actually know.</li>
<li>Contributed many small patches to the build system. Mostly general
  cleanup so far. Although, I have much bigger plans in the works.</li>
<li>Many miscellaneous small things. (I get distracted easily.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that list doesn't seem too shabby. But, a lot of it is smaller
ticket items. I don't think there's anything there worth writing home
about.  Whatever. The future is looking bright for Firefox Sync (Persona
integration will make Sync usable by millions more) and new sync
backends are coming (including search engine sync). So, I'm fine with
not having a longer list of big ticket contributions after only a year.</p>
<h2>On Ramping up at Mozilla</h2>
<p>I will be the first to admit that I had a difficult time getting into
the groove at Mozilla and my first months (dare I say my first half
year) were unproductive by my personal standards.</p>
<p>I can't say I wasn't warned. My manager (Mike Connor) told me
multiple times that it would happen. I was skeptical, insteading
rationalizing that my previous track record of learnly quickly
would hold. He was right. I was wrong. I got fat from the humble pie.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this. For starters, I was starting a new
job. It's almost impossible achieve 100% productivity on your first day.
Second, I was working with tools I knew little about, including
JavaScript and especially including the flavor of JavaScript used
inside Firefox. (Short version: the JavaScript within Firefox is awesome
in that it implements bleeding-edge features of the language.
Unfortunately, the JavaScript inside Firefox/Gecko is contaminated
by this blight called XPCOM. It makes things ugly and not very
JavaScript-y. XPCOM also makes the learning curve that much harder
because now you have to learn multiple technologies at the same time.)
It was daunting.</p>
<p>Not helping matters was the fact that Firefox Sync is complicated.
Syncing data is in of itself a difficult problem. Throw in remote
servers, an HTTP protocol, a encryption, and interaction with systems
inside Firefox that are themselves complicated, and you have a <strong>hard</strong>
problem. My first months were literally spent being a thorn in Philipp
von Wieter^H^H^H^H^H^H philikon's side, barraging him with an endless
stream of questions. I am forever in beer debt to him because of this.
When Philipp left the team to work on Boot 2 Gecko and the rest of the
Firefox Sync team was retasked to work on Android Sync shortly
thereafter, I was on my own little island to manage Firefox Sync.
I kind of felt like Tom Hanks' character in <em>Castaway</em>.</p>
<p>If I have one piece of advice for people starting at Mozilla it's this:
be prepared to be humbled by your own ignorance. There is a lot to
learn. It's not easy. Don't feel bad when you struggle. The payoff is
worth it.</p>
<h2>On Life at Mozilla</h2>
<p>Despite the hurdles I initially faced ramping up at Mozilla, life at
Mozilla is great. This mostly stems from the people, of course.</p>
<p>If you are just looking for technical excellence, I think Mozilla has
one of the highest concentrations of any company in the world. Sure,
larger companies will have <em>more</em> amazing individuals. But, the number
per capita at Mozilla is just staggering. I don't know how many times
I've met or talked with someone only to find out later they are
considered to be one of the best in his or her respective field. Reading
Mozilla's phonebook is like looking at a <em>Who's Who</em> list. For someone
like me who loves being a sponge for knowledge, Mozilla is an environment
in which I can thrive. Just thinking back at everything I've learned in
the past year makes my mind asplode.</p>
<p>On the personal front, the personalities of Mozillians are also top
notch. People are generally helpful and supportive. (They need to be for
an open source project to thrive.) People recognize good ideas when they
hear them and there is comparatively few political battles to be won
when enacting change. People themselves are generally interesting and
passionate about the world and the work they do. If you are living
inside the Mozilla bubble, you may not realize how lucky you have it.
I could give specific examples, but I'd be writing all night. Just
take my word for it.</p>
<p>If you need something to whet your appetite, just check out the
zaniness that is <a href="http://mozillamemes.tumblr.com/">Mozilla Memes</a>.
I don't expect you to understand many of the posts unless you are a
Mozillian or follower of Reddit and know what internet memes are. But, if
you are either, it pretty much sums up a large part of the culture for
you. Sometimes I feel like I'm living in one giant, happy meme.</p>
<p>One of the aspects I love most about working at Mozilla is I finally
feel that my career interests are aligned with an organization I
philosophically agree with. Just read the
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto.html">Mozilla Manifesto</a>. What's
not to like?</p>
<p>This is one of the primary factors that convinced me to join Mozilla.
After Microsoft acquired the startup where I had my first post-college
job (Tellme Networks), I could never hold my head high in Silicon Valley
among my friends in the tech sector. <em>Normal</em> people and those outside
of Silicon Valley were like, "Microsoft, cool!" But, something just
didn't feel right about saying I worked for them. I felt like I was working
for the Empire while I really wanted to be working for the Rebel Alliance.
I felt like I had to atone for my time at Microsoft. I felt like I needed
to cleanse my soul. Mozilla was an obvious answer.</p>
<p>(I don't mean to disparage Microsoft. I actually think the culture has
changed since the days when their behavior earned them the reputation
that Silicon Valley stills holds them accountable for. Still, I would
not work for them in Silicon Valley. Anyway, I'm not here to talk about
the past.)</p>
<p>Mozilla is an organization I'm proud to work for. I exercise that pride
by frequently wearing my awesome Firefox hoodie. Nearly every time I do,
random people come up to me and say how they love Firefox and/or what
Mozilla does for the world. Every time they do, it brings a smile to my
face. This constantly reinforces what I know to be true: that I'm
working for a great organization.</p>
<h2>Future at Mozilla</h2>
<p>I'm already looking forward to the next year at Mozilla. It is already
shaping up to be much, much more productive than my first.</p>
<p>On the roadmap, all of my hacking about with the build system is about
to pay dividends. Ever since my first day at Mozilla I have been
frustrated with the build system and the developer experience one must
go through to contribute to Firefox. After many months of casual (mostly
evenings and weekends) experimentation, my work is about to pay off.</p>
<p>I have successfully formulated a <a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/06/25/improving-mozilla%27s-build-system/">plan of attack</a>
and helped convince others this is what we need to do. We have since
<a href="http://coop.deadsquid.com/2012/07/reviving-buildfaster-plan-of-attack/">committed</a>
to the fundamental components of that plan and are
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774049">tracking</a> its
progress. (I don't mean to take sole or even primary responsibility for
this as the credit resides with a number of people. But, I would like to
think that the dozens of times I championed aspects of this plan in IRC
and in hallway chats before I was the first person to articulate it in a
post helped lay the groundwork for the eventual acceptance of this
project.) Once we see progress on this project, great things will come
from it. I promise.</p>
<p>My work towards making the build system faster had an unintended
consequence: the creation of a new tool that serves as a frontend to the
build system. One day, I took a step backwards and realized that the
potential for such a tool is much greater than simply interacting with
the build system. So, I extracted that work from my build system
hacking and polished it up a bit. It is now
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=751795">one review away</a>
from landing. When it does, thousands of Firefox developers will have a
much better experience when developing Firefox. And, my hope is for
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/showdependencytree.cgi?id=774108">many more features</a>
to follow to make it even more awesome, especially for first-time
contributors. I believe this is important to help advance Mozilla's
Mission.</p>
<p>Improving the developer experience of Firefox is exciting and it will
likely make a lot of people really happy. But, it's neither the most
exciting nor most important project I'll contribute to in the upcoming
year. The most exciting and important project for me will be
refactoring Firefox Sync to make it faster, more robust, sync more data,
and, most importantly, usable by more people.</p>
<p>Firefox Sync stands out from similar products in that it keeps your data
safe. Really safe. I
<a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/04/08/comparing-the-security-and-privacy-of-browser-syncing/">blogged</a>
about this previously. But, I intentionally kept the tone of that post
neutral and factual. The truth is that the security model of Firefox Sync
makes it look like nearly all other products aren't even trying. I take
immense pride in working on a data-sharing feature that makes users'
lives better <strong>without undermining security</strong>. Firefox Sync stands in
rare company in this regard.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in our zeal for the best security possible, we designed a
product that isn't usable by the majority of people because it is too
complicated to set up and is prone to losing your data. In the end, this
doesn't really serve the overall Firefox user base.</p>
<p>We've been hard at work devising the next version of Firefox Sync which
will retain the optimum security and privacy settings of the existing
product while extending usability at nearly-comparable security and
ofer data recovery to the vast majority of our users. <strong>This is huge.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I'm pretty damn excited about my next year at Mozilla.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Smaller Firefox Build Logs</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day I looked at a full Firefox build log from TBPL and noticed
that ~84,000 of the ~170,000 lines in the log I looked at was output
from archive processes. We were printing thousands of lines showing the
files that were being added and extracted from the archives that contain
test files!</p>
<p>I thought this was wasteful, so I filed
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=757397">bug 757397</a> and
coded up a patch. Ted agreed that these lines were rather worthless and
the patch has landed in mozilla-inbound.</p>
<p>The result of the patch is build logs are about half as big in terms of
lines. And, it appears at least 500kb is shaved off the compressed log
files as well.</p>
<p>The real world impact is you should be able to load build logs from
the server faster because they are smaller.</p>
<p>If you were parsing this data before and are impacted by this, please
leave a comment on the aforementioned bug and we'll go from there.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Better Sharing of Test Code in Mozilla Projects</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just <a href="https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Mozilla-Inbound&amp;rev=b063ba6dd084">landed</a>
in mozilla-inbound (Firefox's integration tree) is
support for test-only JavaScript modules. That is, JavaScript modules
that are utilized by just test code. This is being tracked in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=748490">bug 748490</a>.</p>
<p>The use case for this feature is sharing common test code, mock types,
etc between tests. For example, in the Services code, we have a number
of mock types (like a JS implementation of the Sync HTTP server) that
need to be utilized across sub-modules. With test-only modules, it is
now possible to publish these modules to a common location and import
them using the familiar Cu.import() syntax. Previously, you had to
perform the equivalent of a <em>#include</em> (possibly by utilizing the
<em>[head]</em> section of xpcshell.ini files). The previous method of
importing is dirty because you pollute the global object. Furthermore,
it is really inconvenient when you wish to utilize shared files from
different directories. See
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/f80568dba010/services/sync/tests/unit/xpcshell.ini#l2">this file</a>
for an example.</p>
<p>The new method of publishing and consuming test-only JavaScript modules
is clean and simple. From your Makefile, define <strong>TESTING_JS_MODULES</strong> to
a list of (JavaScript) files to publish. Optionally, define
<strong>TESTING_JS_MODULE_DIR</strong> to the relative path they should be published
to. If the directory variable is not defined, they will be published to
the root directory. Here is an example Makefile.in:</p>
<pre><code>DEPTH     = ../..
topsrcdir = @top_srcdir@
srcdir    = @srcdir@

include $(DEPTH)/config/autoconf.mk

TESTING_JS_MODULES = mockserver.js common.js
TESTING_JS_MODULE_DIR = foobar
</code></pre>
<p>All test modules are installed to a common directory somewhere in the
object directory. Where is not relevant. Just know it is outside the
normal distribution directory, so the test modules aren't packaged. This
common directory is registered with the resource manager under
<em>resource://testing/</em>. So, once a build is performed, you can import these
files via Components.utils.import():</p>
<pre><code>Cu.import("resource://testing-common/foobar/mockserver.js");
</code></pre>
<p>I hope this feature facilitates better reuse of test code. So, next time
you are writing test code, please consider writing writing and publishing it
as a module so others can utilize it.</p>
<p>One more thing. Currently, integration with the resource manager is only
implemented for xpcshell tests. I'd like to see this supported in all
the test runners eventually. I implemented xpcshell support because a)
that is the test harness I use almost exclusively and b) it is the only
one I'm comfortable modifying. If you want to implement support in
another test runner, please have a go at it!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Improving the Mozilla Build System Experience</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>tl;dr User experience matters and developers are people too. I
have proposed a tool to help developers interact with the Firefox build
system and source tree.</em></p>
<p>I don't think I have to make my case when I state that Mozilla's build
system end-user experience is lacking. There are lots of hurdles to overcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine where to obtain the source code.</li>
<li>Install a source control system (possibly).</li>
<li>Wait a <em>long</em> time for the large source repository to download.</li>
<li>Figure out how to launch the build process (unlike many other build
  systems, it isn't as simple as <code>configure</code> or <code>make</code> - although it is
  close).</li>
<li>Determine which dependencies need to be installed and install them
  (this can also take a long time).</li>
<li>Create a configuration file (mozconfig).</li>
<li>Build the tree (another long process).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to contribute patches, there are additional steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure Mercurial with your personal info.</li>
<li>Configure Mercurial to generate patches in proper format.</li>
<li>Create a Bugzilla account (made simpler through Persona!).</li>
<li>Figure out the proper Bugzilla product/component (even I still
  struggle at this) so you can file a bug.</li>
<li>Figure out how to attach a patch to a bug and request review (it isn't
  intuitive if you've never used Bugzilla before).</li>
<li>Figure out who should review patch.</li>
<li>Learn how tests work so you can:</li>
<li>Write new tests.</li>
<li>Run existing tests to verify your changes.</li>
<li>Obtain commit access (so at least you can push to Try).</li>
<li>Learn how to push to Try.</li>
<li>Learn about <a href="https://tbpl.mozilla.org/">TBPL</a>.</li>
<li>Discover and use some of the amazing tools to help you
  (<a href="https://mxr.mozilla.org/">MXR</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pbiggar/trychooser">trychooser</a>,
  <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sfink/mqext">mqext</a>, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>Granted, not all of these are required. But, they will be for returning
contributors. My point is that there are lots of steps here. And, every
one of them represents a point where someone could get frustrated and
bail -- a point where Mozilla loses a potential contributor.</p>
<p>Ever since I started at Mozilla, I've been thinking of ways this could
be done better. While the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Developer_Guide">Developer Guide</a>
on MDN has improved drastically in the last year, there are still many
ways the process could be improved and streamlined.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=751795">bug 751795</a>,
I've put forward the groundwork of a tool to make the developer
experience more user friendly. Yes, this is a vague goal, so let me go
in to further detail.</p>
<p>What I've submitted in the bug is essentially a framework for
performing common actions related to the build system and source tree.
These actions are defined as methods in Python code. Hooking it all
together is a command-line interface which is launched via a short
script in the root directory called <em>mach</em> (<em>mach</em> is German for <em>do</em>).
Since actions speak louder than words, here's an example:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./mach

usage: mach command [command arguments]

This program is your main control point for the Mozilla source tree.

To perform an action, specify it as the first argument. Here are some common
actions:

  mach build         Build the source tree.
  mach help          Show full help.
  mach xpcshell-test Run xpcshell test(s).

To see more help for a specific action, run:

  mach &lt;command&gt; --help

e.g. mach build --help
</code></pre>
<p>And, going into a sub-command:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./mach xpcshell-test --help

usage: mach xpcshell-test [-h] [--debug] [TEST]

positional arguments:
  TEST         Test to run. Can be specified as a single JS file, an
               xpcshell.ini manifest file, a directory, or omitted. If
               omitted, the entire xpcshell suite is executed.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --debug, -d  Run test in debugger.
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I've focused effort at this stage on performing actions after the
initial build environment is configured. The reason is this is
low-hanging fruit and easily allows me to create a proof-of-concept.
But, I have many more ideas that I'd eventually like to see implemented.</p>
<p>One of my grand ideas is to have some kind of setup wizard guide
you through the first time you use <em>mach</em>. It can start by asking the
basics: "Which application do you want to build?" "Release or Debug?"
"Clang or GCC?" "Should I install Clang for you?" It could also be more
intelligent about installing dependencies. "I see you are using Ubuntu
and are missing required packages X and Y. Would you like me to install
them?" And, why stop at a command-line interface? There's no reason a
graphical frontend (perhaps Tcl/Tk) couldn't be implemented!</p>
<p>The setup wizard could even encompass configuring your source control
system for proper patch generation by ensuring your tree-local <em>.hg/hgrc</em>
or <em>.git/config</em> files have the proper settings. We could even ask you
for Bugzilla credentials so you could interact with Bugzilla directly
from the command-line.</p>
<p>Once we have all of the basic configs in place, it's just a matter of
hooking up the plumbing. Want to submit a patch for review? We could
provide a command for that:</p>
<pre><code>./mach submit-patch

"refactor-foo" is currently on top of your patch queue.

Submit "refactor-foo"?
y/n: y

Enter bug number for patch or leave empty for no existing bug.
Bug number:

OK. A new bug for this patch will be created.

Please enter a one-line summary of the patch:
Summary: Refactor foo subsystem

Is the patch for (r)eview, (f)eedback, or (n)either?
r/f/n: r

</code></pre>
<p>The framework is extremely flexible and extensible for a few reasons.
First, it encourages all of the core <em>actions</em> to be implemented as
Python modules/methods. Once you have things defined as API calls (not
shell scripts), the environment feels like a cohesive library rather than
a loose collection of shell scripts. Shell scripts have a place, don't get
me wrong. But, they are hard to debug and test (not to mention performance
penalties on Windows). Writing code as reusable libraries with shell
scripts only being the frontend is a more robust approach to software
design.</p>
<p>Second, the command-line driver is implemented as a collection of
sub-commands. This is similar to how version control systems like Git,
Mercurial, and Subversion work. This makes discovery of features
extremely easy: just list the supported commands! Contrast this to our
current build system, where the answer is to consult a wiki (with likely
out-of-date and fragmented information) or <em>gasp</em> try to read the
makefiles in the tree.</p>
<p>My immediate goal for
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=751795">bug 751795</a> is to
get a minimal framework checked in to the tree with a core design people
are content with. Once that is done, <strong>I'm hoping other people will come
along and implement additional features and commands.</strong> Specifically, I'd
like to see some of the awesome tools like <em>mqext</em> integrated such that
their power can be harnessed without requiring people to first discover
they exist and second install and configure them. I think it is silly for
these obvious productivity wins to go unused by people ignrant of their
existence. If they are valuable, let's ship them as part of a batteries
included environment.</p>
<p>In the long run, I think there are many more uses for this framework.
For starters, it gives us a rallying point around which to organize all
of the Python support/tools code in the tree. Currently, we have things
spread all over the place. Quite frankly, it is a mess. I'd like to have
a unified <em>site-packages</em> tree with all our Python so things are easier to
locate and thus improve.</p>
<p>If nothing else, the tool provides a framework for logging and
formatting activities in a unified way. There are separate log streams:
one for humans, one for machines. Under the hood, they both use the
saming logging infrastructure. When messages are logged, the human
stream is formatted as simple sentences (complete with terminal
encodings and colorization). The machine-destined log stream is
newline-delimited JSON containing the fields that were logged. This
allows analysis of output without having to parse strings. This is how
all log analysis should be done. But, that's for another post. Anyway,
what this all means is that the output for humans can be more readable.
Colors, progress bars: we can do that now.</p>
<p>Over time, I imagine some may want to move logic out of configure and
makefiles and into this tool (because Python is easier to maintain and
debug, IMO). I would love to see that too. But, I want to stress that this
isn't a focus right now. I believe this framework should be supplemental
in the beginning and the official build system should not rely on it. Maybe
that changes in the future. Time will tell.</p>
<p>Anyway, this project is currently just my solo effort. This isn't
captured on a roadmap or anyone's quarterly goals. There is no project page
listing planned features. If you are interested in helping, drop me a line
and/or join in on the bug. Hopefully the core framework will land soon.
Once it does, I'm hoping for an explosion of new, user-friendly
features/commands to make the overall Firefox development experience
smoother.</p>]]></content:encoded>
